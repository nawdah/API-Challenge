## Analysis

### Latitude vs. Temperature Plot

![Max Temp](/WeatherPy/lat_vs_max_temp.png)

As shown in the plot, latitudes ranging from -60 to 10 yield high maximum temperatures. This goes to show that the closer you get to the equator, the hotter it becomes.

### Latitude vs. Humidity Plot

![Humidity](/WeatherPy/lat_vs_humidity.png)

Humidity has been consistent for the latitude ranges. As you get closer to the equator, there appears to be a dense cluster of measurements, pointing out high recorded humidity percentages.

### Latitude vs. Cloudiness Plot

The plot above shows that the farther away from the equator, the more likely you will encounter a high cloudiness percentage in the region.
